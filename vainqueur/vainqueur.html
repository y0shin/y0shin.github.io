<li><strong>Tokens</strong><br>
Tokens are items used to represent monsters or masters created via card effects. Any object can be used as long as it has two distinct ways to place it.</li>
<li><strong>Counters</strong><br>
Some cards will require a marker(<em>counter</em>) to keep track of things, any object can be used as a counter but it is recommended that you use a die.</li>
<li><strong>Calculator</strong><br>

</ul>

<ul>

<h2 id="how-to-read-a-card">How to Read a Card</h2>
<p><img src="./vainqueur_files/card_labled.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Name</strong><br>
This is the card’s name. If cards have the same name they are considered to be the same card.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong><br>
This identifier will help you to determine what kind of card it is. Monsters and Masters additionally have a Subtype before the Type.</li>
<li><strong>Effect Box</strong><br>
Card effects are written here, describing the card’s abilities and how to use them.</li>
<li><strong>Monster Rank</strong><br>
This is a value used to determine the amount of tributes requires to Summon a monster.<br>
α monsters require no tributes, β monsters require 1 tribute and Ω monsters require 2 tributes. Masters have HP here.</li>
<li><strong>STR/DEF</strong><br>
STR is a monsters strength and DEF is a monster’s defense. These values are used for attacking.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="summoning-monster-cards"><strong>Summoning Monster Cards</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Regular Summon</strong> *</p>
<p>This is the easiest and most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a α Monster card from your hand into the Monster Field in Battle-Ready or Defending positions(<em>cont.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Summoning β and Ω Monsters</strong> *</p>
<p>To summon these monsters you must tribute the appropriate amount of monsters you control before you summon the monster. β Monsters require 1 monster tribute to summon whereas Ω Monsters require 2 monster tributes. These are both counted as Regular Summons.</p>
<p>*: <em>You can only do 2 Regular Summons per turn</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alter Summoning Monsters</strong></p>
<p>Some Monsters can be played onto the field without a Regular Summon. This is called an Alter Summon. Alter Summoning is usually result of a card effect. To Alter Summon simply put the Monster into the Monster Field. There is no limit on the amount of Alter Summons.</p>
<p><strong>Battle Positions</strong></p>
<p>There are two positions a Monster can have when summoned: Battle-Ready and Defending. A Battle-Ready Monster can attack and is played facing forwards. Defending cards cannot attack and are played rotated to the right.</p>
<h1 id="using-card-effects"><strong>Using Card Effects</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Monster Cards</strong><br>
Monster Cards may additionally have effects that you can only activate once per turn while on the field. If you have 2 of the same Monster in play both may activate their effect. You can only activate Monster effects during your Main Step.</p>
<p><strong>Master Cards</strong><br>
Master Cards have effects that typically alter the game state and are ongoing. The instant a Master leaves the field its effect ends. Master effects may be activated during any step,</p>
<p><strong>Battlefield Cards</strong><br>
Battlefield Cards have effects that much like Master Cards are ongoing. Battlefield effects affect both players, not just the card’s controller. The instant a Battlefield leaves the field its effect ends. Battlefield effects may be activated during any step.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Cards</strong><br>
Spell Cards have one-time effects. To use a spell simply play it anywhere on the Game Field and apply its effect. Once the effect is applied send the Spell to the Cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>React Spell Cards</strong><br>
React Spell Cards are a sub-type of Spell Card that may be played at any point in a game. They are used exactly the same as Spells.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-a-game">Preparing a Game</h3>
<p>Before starting a game make sure to follow these steps (<em>in order</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Shuffle your deck thoroughly. You may also shuffle and cut your opponent’s deck.</li>
<li>Place your deck face-down in the Deck Zone</li>
<li>Call a coin flip or die roll, the winner decides which player goes first.</li>
<li>Draw 6 cards, this is your starting hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you may proceed with your turn, which is broken down into steps that are played in order:</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong><br>
This is the first step. Used during game setup and before you draw a card. No game actions can be done at this time.<br>
<strong>Draw</strong><br>
The player whose turn it is draws 1 card from the top of their deck. A player with no cards left in their deck and is unable to draw loses the game. After you draw you may activate React Spells.<br>
<strong>Main</strong><br>
This is when you play the majority of your cards: You can Summon Monsters, play Masters and Battlefields and activate Spells of any type. You may also change the battle position of a Monster you control once.<br>
<strong>Attack</strong><br>
During this Step Monsters can attack other Monsters, Masters and Players. Monsters must attack other Monsters before they can attack Masters and Players. Monsters can only attack once. You may activate React Spells in this step. After all monsters attack move on to the Post-Attack Step.<br>
<strong>Post-Attack</strong><br>
This step is used for card effects that apply after you Attack. You may activate React Spells in this step.<br>
<strong>End</strong><br>
You end your turn, the opponent now enters their Preparation Step.</p>
